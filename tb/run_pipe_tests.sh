# AP040_PIPE self-test suite -- the pipelined core under active development
# (rtl/ap040_pipe_core.v and its stage files). Needs only iverilog: every
# tb_ap040_pipe_*.v bench pokes its own tiny program directly into
# ap040_inst_fetch.v's ROM (dut.u_if.rom[...]) at time 0, so there is no
# assembler dependency here the way run_tests.sh has for the rtl_old suite.
#
# rtl/ap040_pipe_core.v is deliberately self-contained (see its header) --
# this is the complete source list, no other rtl/ or rtl_old/ file is ever
# needed to build it.

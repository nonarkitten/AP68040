// AP040_PIPE - MC68040-style pipelined core (milestone 16: RTS, RTE)       //
//                                                                          //
// ap040_pipe_core.v - top level: wires IF/ID/EA-calc/EA-fetch/EX/WB into a //
// real six-stage pipeline with a synchronous stall/flush chain,            //
// instantiates this directory's own register file and ALU forks and a new //
// architectural CCR, drives the commit (regfile write + CCR update)        //
// directly off EX's registered output, and exposes debug taps for the      //
// test.                                                                    //
//                                                                          //
// Deliberately named ap040_pipe_core, not ap040_core: it must never        //
// collide with, or be silently substitutable for, the working sequential   //
// core in rtl/ap040/ap040_core.v (see the note in                          //
// rtl/ap040/experimental/README about ap040_core_fetchbuffer.v reusing     //
// that name). This module is not referenced by ap040.qip, cpu_wrapper.v    //
// or Minimig.sv -- it is built and tested standalone until a later         //
// milestone wires it in deliberately.                                     //
//                                                                          //
// Folder independence (new this milestone): earlier milestones reused      //
// rtl/ap040/ap040_regfile.v and rtl/ap040/ap040_alu.v directly, adding a    //
// couple of small, deliberately-additive changes to the shared files       //
// (a WRITE_THROUGH parameter, a debug tap). The user decided that's not    //
// the structure wanted: rtl/ap040/ stays completely untouched from here    //
// on, and rtl/ap040_pipe/ is fully self-contained -- deleting either        //
// directory can never affect the other. Both shared files are forked into  //
// this directory as ap040_pipe_regfile.v/ap040_pipe_alu.v (same collision- //
// avoidance naming as this module itself), and ap040_pipe_defs.svh no      //
// longer reaches into rtl/ap040/ for constants either.                     //
//                                                                          //
// Stall handshake: each stage's *_stall output is driven straight from its //
// own stall_in input (no stage has multi-cycle work yet), so the six-stage //
// chain currently collapses to "never stall" -- but the wiring is real,    //
// stage by stage, so a later milestone only has to change one stage's      //
// local stall condition rather than restructure the pipeline. The whole    //
// core advances only when ce is high, matching the clock-enable discipline //
// used throughout rtl/ap040/ap040_core.v.                                  //
//                                                                          //
// Commit and forwarding: the register file is instantiated here (not      //
// inside a stage module), mirroring where the existing sequential core     //
// instantiates it (ap040_core.v:222-233). The write port is driven         //
// directly off exe_* (EX's registered output -- the instruction            //
// conceptually "in WB" this cycle). A same-cycle read of the register      //
// being written is resolved inside the regfile itself (unconditional in    //
// this fork -- see ap040_pipe_regfile.v); the other hazard case -- a        //
// producer still combinationally computing in EX, one stage ahead of a      //
// consumer's EA-fetch cycle -- is resolved in ap040_ea_fetch.v via the      //
// ex_fwd_* bus below. See ap040_ea_fetch.v's header comment for the full    //
// picture, including the mutation test that confirmed a separate            //
// WB-forward mux there would have been redundant.                          //
//                                                                          //
// CCR/SR forwarding: the same write-through shape used for GPRs is reused   //
// for the architectural SR register: sr_resolved = commit_sr ? exe_sr_data  //
// : commit_ccr ? {sr[15:5],exe_result_flags} : sr (milestone 15 widened     //
// this from a CCR-only 5-bit version -- see its own note below). This is    //
// the only forwarding source ap040_execute.v's Bcc condition check (and,    //
// since milestone 6, Scc's byte fill) needs -- see its header comment for   //
// why an EX-live tap (the second source GPR forwarding needed) isn't        //
// necessary here.                                                          //
//                                                                          //
// commit_reg vs commit_ccr (new this milestone): these were a single        //
// `commit` signal through milestone 5, correct because every writing        //
// instruction so far (MOVEQ/MOVE.L/ADD.L) always did both together. Scc     //
// breaks that -- it writes a register but must never touch CCR (confirmed   //
// against ap040_core.v:2122-2130's EK_SCC) -- so the regfile write enable   //
// and the CCR update enable are now genuinely separate signals, gated by    //
// exe_writes_reg and exe_writes_ccr respectively.                          //
//                                                                          //
// Field set note (2026-08-21 code-quality pass): the original milestone-2  //
// draft threaded opcode/is_nop/is_move_rr/unimpl through every stage as    //
// one-hot-ish flags. A review found most of that unread past the stage     //
// that produced it, and the scheme didn't generalize. Decode now emits a   //
// compact control word instead; see ap040_decode.v's header for the        //
// reasoning, confirmed again by milestone 3 (ADD) and milestone 6 (Scc)     //
// each needing only new fields/values, never a restructure.                //
//                                                                          //
// Milestone 4 added BRA.B's redirect as a genuinely separate, orthogonal   //
// path (id_redirect_valid/id_redirect_pc, decode -> IF) rather than         //
// folding it into the control word -- it isn't an ALU operation or a        //
// register write, it's IF's own next-fetch address.                        //
//                                                                          //
// Milestone 5 generalized that redirect to the whole Bcc family (BRA is     //
// just Bcc's always-true case, per ap040_decode.v's header) and added the   //
// real misprediction path: ex_mispredict/ex_recovery_pc (from EX, once the  //
// real condition is known) take PRIORITY over decode's speculative guess    //
// at IF's redirect mux, and broadcast as `flush` to ID/EA-calc/EA-fetch to  //
// discard whatever was speculatively advanced down the (wrong) guess.       //
//                                                                          //
// Milestone 7 adds Bcc.W/Bcc.L (16-/32-bit displacement) via a multi-word   //
// gather state machine confined entirely to ap040_decode.v -- IF still      //
// hands over one word per cycle, oblivious to instruction boundaries; see   //
// its header comment. The one change visible at this level is *_next_pc,   //
// threaded alongside *_pc through every stage: ex_recovery_pc now reads     //
// eaf_next_pc directly instead of computing eaf_pc + 32'd2, since that       //
// arithmetic assumed every instruction was exactly one word (true by        //
// coincidence until Bcc.W/Bcc.L).                                          //
//                                                                          //
// Milestone 8 adds DBcc via a THIRD gate on the same commit signals rather   //
// than new ones: *_is_dbcc threads alongside *_is_branch/*_is_scc through    //
// every stage (mechanical pass-through, same shape as those two), and        //
// ap040_execute.v's writes_reg_resolved -- not this file -- is what makes     //
// commit_reg dynamic for it (DBcc writes Dn only when its runtime condition   //
// says so; see ap040_execute.v's header). ex_mispredict/ex_recovery_pc are    //
// reused completely unchanged: DBcc's "don't branch" outcomes are, from       //
// this file's point of view, indistinguishable from a not-taken Bcc.         //
//                                                                          //
// Milestone 13 adds BSR/JSR and, with them, this pipeline's first real        //
// memory WRITE: u_l1's port B (data_b/wren_b) is no longer tied off, driven    //
// instead by ap040_ea_fetch.v's own l1_data_b/l1_wren_b outputs -- the SAME     //
// port A/JMP/JSR's reads already share, since an instruction is never both      //
// a read and a push at once. *_is_bsr/*_is_jsr thread through the same           //
// mechanical pass-through shape as *_is_jmp; the actual push logic (address,      //
// data, stall) lives entirely in ap040_ea_fetch.v, and the A7 write reuses the     //
// existing commit_reg path below unchanged (ap040_decode.v points its              //
// eac_dest_reg at A7's unified index, same as any other register-writing            //
// instruction) -- nothing new needed at this level for that half either.             //
//                                                                          //
// Milestone 15 replaces the bare 5-bit `ccr` register with a real 16-bit    //
// `sr` (T1/T0/S/M/IPL/CCR, matching AP040_SR_RESET's layout exactly) and     //
// adds VBR/SFC/DFC/CACR -- the supervisor state MOVEC/MOVE-to-SR/privilege   //
// violation all need. sr_s/sr_m feeding ap040_pipe_regfile.v's A7 bank are   //
// finally REAL bits of live state (sr[13]/sr[12]), not hardwired constants;  //
// the regfile's own aux_we/aux_sel/aux_wdata port -- present since the        //
// register file was first written, unused until now -- gets its first real    //
// driver, for MOVEC's USP/ISP/MSP targets. Three new commit paths join         //
// commit_reg/commit_ccr: commit_sr (MOVE-to-SR, or an exception forcing S=1     //
// unconditionally on entry) writes the WHOLE sr register at once; commit_creg    //
// (MOVEC's write direction) writes exactly one of VBR/SFC/DFC/CACR/USP/ISP/       //
// MSP, selected by ap040_execute.v's exe_creg_sel. See ap040_ea_fetch.v's           //
// header for where the privilege check itself happens (dynamically, off the         //
// live S bit -- decode alone can't know it) and ap040_execute.v's header for         //
// the exact SR-masking arithmetic exception entry applies.                            //
//                                                                          //
// Milestone 16 adds RTS/RTE, closing the loop BSR/JSR (the push) and                //
// illegal/TRAP/priv (the exception-entry push) opened: this pipeline can now         //
// actually RETURN, not just enter. No new top-level architectural state is            //
// needed here at all -- both instructions reuse machinery this file already           //
// wires (the regfile's commit_reg path for A7's new value, commit_sr for RTE's         //
// popped SR) -- see ap040_ea_fetch.v's header for the new 2-beat pop sequencer          //
// RTE needed and why RTS didn't (it reuses mem_issue/mem_complete verbatim).             //

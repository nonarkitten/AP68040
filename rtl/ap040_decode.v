// real exception-entry path -- see id_is_illegal below and                 //
// ap040_ea_fetch.v's header for the mechanism. A future milestone MAY      //
// split the 1010/1111-top-nibble opcode classes into their own A-line/     //
// F-line vectors (10/11) instead of folding them into ILLEGAL -- not done  //
// here because nothing in this decoder's current scope actually produces   //
// those top nibbles, so there is no test coverage to verify the split      //
// against; documented rather than silently wrong.                          //

// TRAP #n (milestone 14, new): 0100 1110 0100 nnnn (0x4E40-0x4E4F, n =     //
// vector-32 in the low 4 bits). Single word, no gather, no EA, no operand   //
// read at all -- the only thing decode contributes beyond recognizing the   //
// opcode is computing the actual vector NUMBER (32+n) into id_imm, reused    //
// exactly the way BSR/JMP/JSR already reuse it for a displacement (a          //
// "general-purpose field", per MOVE.L (d16,An),Dn's header note) rather        //
// than adding a dedicated port for one 8-bit value. Like BSR/JSR, decode        //
// points id_dest_reg at A7 (4'd15) and sets id_writes_reg -- TRAP pushes an      //
// exception frame and decrements A7 exactly like a subroutine call, just         //
// with the target and frame contents supplied by ap040_ea_fetch.v's new          //
// exception-entry sequencer instead of a literal branch displacement.             //

// Illegal instruction (milestone 14, new): id_is_illegal is precisely the   //
// boolean every opcode-recognition wire above this comment does NOT match    //
// -- the same expression id_unimpl used to compute, renamed and (for the      //
// first time) actually threaded downstream, since ap040_ea_fetch.v's           //
// exception-entry sequencer is now a real consumer, not a future one. Also       //
// points id_dest_reg at A7/sets id_writes_reg, same shape as TRAP -- an           //
// illegal-instruction exception pushes a frame and decrements A7 too, per         //
// ap040_core.v's go_illegal task (format $0, vector 4). The one difference         //
// from TRAP: the frame's stacked PC is the illegal instruction's OWN address        //
// (id_pc), not the following instruction's (id_next_pc) -- you can't "return         //
// past" an illegal opcode the way TRAP's handler returns past the TRAP itself;        //
// see ap040_ea_fetch.v's header for where that distinction is actually applied.        //
//                                                                          //
// BSR (milestone 13, new): the SAME opcode class as Bcc (0110 cccc          //

// 4 specifically because it needed a stack push. Reuses Bcc's byte/word/    //
// long gather AND its speculative decode-time redirect verbatim -- BSR is    //
// UNCONDITIONALLY taken (like BRA's cond_true(0)==1 always), so decode's      //
// "assume taken" guess is always correct and needs no EX-side correction.     //
// Kept as its own id_is_bsr flag rather than folded into id_is_branch,         //
// though, because ap040_execute.v's Bcc path checks cond_true(eaf_cond) --      //
// and BSR's condition-code field bits (0001, the literal "F" encoding) would     //
// make that check ALWAYS evaluate false and wrongly fire a misprediction if       //
// BSR were misclassified as a plain branch. Verified against ap040_core.v's        //
// S_BCC_EXT (ap040_core.v:3020-3031, the `ir[11:8]==4'h1` arm) and its byte-         //

// port B (id_dest_reg, normally unused by JMP) is free for exactly that: JSR          //
// sets id_dest_reg to A7's unified index (4'd15) -- the register the push+             //

//    -- meaning depends on held_is_dbcc/held_is_move_disp".                    //
//  - This gather must NOT trigger IF's speculative redirect. Every prior        //
//    gather user (Bcc.W/L, DBcc) is something that MIGHT branch, so             //

//    correctness bug (confirmed by mutation-testing the guard back out; see       //
//    ap040_execute.v-adjacent test notes / AP040_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).          //

// instruction: for MOVE.L (An),Dn, eac_imm is 0 (see the id_imm fix below),         //
// so the addition is a no-op; for (d16,An) it's the real displacement. One          //

// id_imm fix (this milestone, affects the PLAIN (An) case too): the single-       //
// word decode branch previously set id_imm unconditionally to the sign-             //
// extended opcode LOW BYTE for every instruction, correct for MOVEQ and             //
// harmless-because-unused for everything else -- until ap040_ea_fetch.v             //
// started actually ADDING eac_imm to the address this milestone. MOVE.L             //
// (An),Dn's own opcode low byte (e.g. 0x10 for (A0),D0) would have been              //

// Fixed by explicitly zeroing id_imm for is_move_mem_l in that branch; caught         //
// by re-running tb_ap040_pipe_move_mem.v (unaffected, since eac_imm is 0             //

// The one thing DBcc needs that Bcc never did: it both reads AND writes Dn, //

// Multi-word gather (new this milestone): ap040_inst_fetch.v still hands   //

// The_68040_processor_I_Design_and_impleme.pdf describes an 8-word buffer  //
// and a 3-word decode window; disproportionate to what's needed here and   //
// not what section 16's "architecturally-equivalent, not cycle-exact"      //
// non-goal calls for). Instead, THIS stage recognizes when it needs more   //
// words than the one it's looking at, and spends the next 1-2 cycles       //
// treating ap040_inst_fetch.v's incoming words as extension DATA rather    //

// Two facts this relies on, verified against ap040_core.v's own            //
// implementation rather than assumed:                                      //
//  - the branch-displacement base is ALWAYS opcode_pc + 2 regardless of     //
//    form (ap040_core.v's br_base <= pc is captured at the same decode      //
//    instant for all three forms, before any extension word is fetched) --  //
//    so only the displacement's width/source changes between forms, not     //
//    the base formula Bcc.B already uses.                                   //
//  - word order for the 32-bit form is high-word-first: ap040_core.v:1817's //
//    imm <= {imm[15:0], epf_data[...]} shifts each new word in as the new   //
//    low half, so the first-fetched word becomes the high half once the     //

// id_next_pc (new this milestone, every instruction not just branches):     //

// ap040_execute.v's fall-through/recovery address (eaf_pc + 2) was correct  //
// only by coincidence of scope. A 2-/3-word Bcc breaks that. The general    //
// fix -- needed for every future variable-length instruction, not just      //

// the full displacement is known -- immediately, from if_opcode alone, for  //
// the byte form (same cycle it's fetched, before it's even latched into     //
// id_*); on the gather-completing cycle for the word/long forms -- for      //
// EVERY branch regardless of its actual condition, the "always assume       //
// taken" policy the real 68040 uses. For BRA (cond_true(0)==1 always) the   //
// guess is always right and nothing downstream ever needs to correct it.    //
// For a real Bcc, the guess can be wrong; id_is_branch/id_cond are threaded //
// onward (through ap040_ea_calc.v/ap040_ea_fetch.v unchanged) so            //
// ap040_execute.v can check the real condition once CCR forwarding actually //
// has something to forward (see its header comment for why EX, not here,   //
// is where that check has to happen) and signal a flush back through this  //
// stage's `flush` input if the guess was wrong.                            //
//                                                                          //
// Scc.B Dn shares id_cond's field position with Bcc (both put the 4-bit     //
// condition at if_opcode[11:8]), so it reuses id_cond directly -- no new    //
// condition field, and ap040_execute.v's cond_true() (all 16 encodings,     //
// not a subset) is reused by both consumers as-is. Scc's dest register is   //
// at if_opcode[2:0], NOT if_opcode[11:9] like MOVEQ/MOVE.L/ADD.L's dest --  //
// for Scc that upper field is the condition code instead -- so             //
